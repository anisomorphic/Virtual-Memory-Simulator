Virtual Memory Simulator

In order to run this Virtual Memory simulator written in c, first navigate 
to the source file location in the terminal and run the command:

	gcc main.c -o vm && ./vm
	
This will compile and execute the simulation, and print output to standard out 
with the default test case of 1. Different test cases can be executed by changing 
the RUN_CASE variable on line 48 to an integer between [1-8], with 8 being the
custom test case discussed in Project2.[docx,pdf].
